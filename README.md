Windows Answer File Generator is a PyQT based open-source application that helps users create Windows Answer files for an easy Windows installation.
It is meant to be a one-stop shop for everything Windows installation related. This includes creating users, installing applications
and automating the install process.


This project supports my Bsc thesis titled "Automatic Windows Operating System Installation". The thesis text can be found using the  [Handle.Net](https://hdl.handle.net/2437/339853) registry.
